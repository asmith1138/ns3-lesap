- Application needed for Sybil nodes
- Application needed for Blackhole nodes
- Modify routing algorithm to validate location of each neighbor (lower distance)
	- Will need to do this multiple times for various routing algorithms
	- aodv-neighbors continues to work as normal
	- aodv-lidar will manage this change
x Use application on nodes to manage blacklists
- Use routing algorithm to manage blacklists (works for AODV, easily)
	- Make the blacklist timeout settable by the script
	- Set to total time of simulation for permanent blacklisting(or other value as required)
	- Will need to do this multiple times for various routing algorithms
- 1 or 2 Applications needed for normal nodes


Needs for LESAP-AODV
