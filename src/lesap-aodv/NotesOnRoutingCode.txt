+ Application needed for Sybil nodes (use same as normal nodes)
+ Application needed for Blackhole nodes (use same as normal nodes)
+ Modify routing algorithm to validate location of each neighbor (lower distance)
	x Will need to do this multiple times for various routing algorithms
	+ aodv-neighbors continues to work as normal
	+ aodv-lidar will manage this change
x Use application on nodes to manage blacklists
+ Use routing algorithm to manage blacklists (works for AODV, easily)
	+ Make the blacklist timeout settable by the script
	+ Set to total time of simulation for permanent blacklisting(or other value as required)
	x Will need to do this multiple times for various routing algorithms
- 1 or 2 Applications needed for normal nodes


Needs for LESAP-AODV



- Sybil Nodes
	- pretend to be multiple nodes? why?
	- to report other nodes as malicious
	- when you recieve a message report that node as malicious to all neighbors
	x act as universal route so you can see all the messages
	- need to extend routing algorithm to track lidar neighbors

- Blackhole nodes
	- response that they have an easy route
	- ignore messages when asked to forward

- Grayhole nodes
	- response that they have an easy route
	- ignore some messages when asked to forward

x Blackhole nodes ver2 (probably out of scope)
	x response that they have an easy route
	x snoop messages when asked to forward
